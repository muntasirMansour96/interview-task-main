- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.
```
It's a technique used to analyze data which used to compare number of different value from different sources for example 

- in z-score technique, the data transformation is done by the values conversion to a common scale where an average 
    number equals zero and standard deviation is one. Z-score normalization tell me how many standard deviations 
    from the mean your score is.
    
- min-max scale consists of establishing a new base of reference for each data point. Often called max-min normalization, 
this technique allows analysts to take the difference of the maximum x value and minimum x value in the set

```

- We used Junit5 in our test cases, describe in your own words why would we use such library? 
what is unit testing and why would we use it?
```
JUnit testing is a simple framework to write and run repeatable tests, it provides a simple api to test 
our java applications the class or method we want to test is usaully called as subject under test. so to 
write a test we simply create a java test class and use JUnit api to make some assumptions towards the 
behavior of the subject under test.
```
- What is the IDE did you use?
```
IntelliJ IDEA 2021.3.2
```

- Name the Java APIs you used?
```
- NIO APIs
- java stream APIs
- Java Collections APIs
- JUnit APIs
```

- Mention down any difficulties or concerns you faced while working on the task. Your feedback is appreciated :D.
```
The only difficulty that I faced was the lack of time because I am currently 
working in the Arab Bank and I did not have enough time to complete all the additional bounce points, 
but I tried to complete the tasks so that you could perform the tasks in an excellent manner
```

- If you implement any of the bonus points, please mentioned it in this file
```
- add some validation to the project
- add more test cases to unit test
- Provide an executable jar file that can find in target folder by name [interview-task-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar]
  java -jar interview-task-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /home/user/in/marks.csv /home/user/out/marks_normalized.csv mark z-score
```

- Did this task enrich technical skills or knowledge? If yes, tell us how: 
```
Yes, I have developed my knowledge of how to deal with files and how to use Java APIs to perform this task by using NIO API
```
